spring-webservices-tutorial
==

Sample code that uses Spring 2.0.0, log4j and a servlet 2.5 web.xml file. Built with Maven and includes Eclipse facets.
So it runs happily under the Eclipse Tomcat server.
Provides a web service endpoint, testable with SOAPUI.

 * Upgrade to spring 4.2.3
 * Use logback (done)
 * Use servlet 3.0 and eliminate web.xml file
 * Move the generated files to target/generated
 * Add an attachment (actually two) to the request
 * Add an attachment to the response
